# jsonFormat

A simple CLI Utility for formatting JSON files

## Usage

```
jsonFormat FILE > PRETTYFILE

## OR

cat FILE | jsonFormat > PRETTYFILE
```

## Installation

Just run the file `install.sh` in project root

### NOTE

"installing" just creates a symlink into `/usr/local/bin`.
The expectation is that this repo will continue to be whereever it is at time of install.
